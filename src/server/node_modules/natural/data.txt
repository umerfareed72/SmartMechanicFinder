Hacktress and          Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts          about a new open  number_wquctgtkut  network she's found. "I am here at          the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I          would check to see if there is connectivity", she writes,          somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list.

Cypherpunk          and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four          or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends          them off to be patented in his name.

All the usual          fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto          cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in          headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig          fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other          epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker          ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme          Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We          suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's          job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for          a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.           url_dzdepyvagh  - doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?           For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without           thinking of Martian fighting machines and their "deafening           howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report           that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR           OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety           issues". The event was to feature computer graphics,           fireworks, " number_wquctgtkut ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking           "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the           possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with           Hawkwind, but UKP number_wquctgtkut  tickets for the Sat  number_wquctgtkut - number_wquctgtkut - number_wquctgtkut  show at           Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new           venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original           invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety           issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the           humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this           earth: bacteria.
